Neuron: A building block of ANN. It is responsible for accepting input data, performing calculations, and producing output.

Input data: Information or data provided to the neurons.

Artificial Neural Network(ANN): A computational system inspired by the way biological neural networks in the human brain process information.

Deep Neural Network: An ANN with many layers placed between the input layer and the output layer.

Weights: The strength of the connection between two neurons. Weights determine what impact the input will have on the output.

Bias: An additional parameter used along with the sum of the product of weights and inputs to produce an output.
